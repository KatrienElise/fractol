 
TAKE TROUGH:
-extra fractols? sine

 CHANGES:
 taking away no event in event_key.
  //res = event_key2(keycode, fract);
   // if (res == 1)
     //   fract->no_event = 1;

BONUS:
-change stable colors
-change unstable colors
-change julia with keys
-moving with arrow
-choose size window
-shift between fractol while in fractol
-change iterations/detail
-show index text
-reste function
-zoom with klick
-freeze in julia
-use of threads to speed up


CONTEXT ERROR:
-bus error starten programma
-bus error 10
In other words the memory tried to access by the program is 
not a valid memory address.
-segmentation fault 11
In other words when the program tries to access the 
memory to which it doesnâ€™t have access to.when the program tries to write/read 
outside the memory allocated for it or when writing memory which can only be read.

The main difference between Segmentation Fault and Bus Error is that Segmentation Fault indicates an invalid 
access to a valid memory, while Bus Error indicates an access to an invalid address.
