Keycodes give fract->colornb a code, nb 1, 2, ,3, 4 etc
Each code is connected to a specific function 
In the main code, is a function port, which checks for each number and sends Loui to 
the code.
so if fract->colornb == 1, go to ft_color_1(fract);

in this function the RGB values will be set according to the fract->it. 

Another thing:

before you put the location and color in memory to send the color with the 
fract->mlx to the function, mlx_get_color_value.. the return of this function will
be the color to sent to the memcpy.

Get a bit more wise in the whole rgb spectrum.


TAKE TROUGH:
-zoom maken
-Gaat de zoom niet goed omdat x en y in x en y 1 worden gezet? 
-na lang inzoomen word die langzaam.
-static functions 
-veradneren van it_max met keycodes kan die minder dan 0 worden?:q


-bus error 10
In other words the memory tried to access by the program is 
not a valid memory address.
-segmentation fault 11
In other words when the program tries to access the 
memory to which it doesnâ€™t have access to.when the program tries to write/read 
outside the memory allocated for it or when writing memory which can only be read.

The main difference between Segmentation Fault and Bus Error is that Segmentation Fault indicates an invalid 
access to a valid memory, while Bus Error indicates an access to an invalid address.

BONUS:
-change stable colors
-change unstable colors
-change julia with keys
-moving with arrow

-extra fractols?
-zoom in at mouse position?
-two fractals in two windos?
