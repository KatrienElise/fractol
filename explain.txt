MAIN.C :
Loui enters in main. This is where main checks if he has the right bagage with him. The rules of the game are easy.
Eather he has two, or he has 4 peaces. If not,l he will be send home. If he has, main sends him to entry. 

ENTRY, (heart.c):
When entry hears someone is coming, it straight away makes his travelbag (the struct). If he is not able to, he 
will stop Loui his journey straight away.  

ft_CALC_ZERO (calc.c)
here all the values in the struct will be put to zero zo there is no garbage value. No he sends loui to fract_compare.

Fract_compare (heart.c) :
Now fract_compare will check Loui his first bag. In here he contains the name of the journey he would like to take. 
There are only a few options, if entry does not reconize one of these name he 
will sent Loui back and tell him what he can choose from, and destroy the struct he made in Error_no_struct. If it is good, 
he sets numbers to fract->name which stands for the names. Then fract_compare sends him to calc_winw_winh.

calc_winw_winh (calc.c);
Sees if Loui has 2 other bags. These can contains the length and with. If Loui does not have another back, fract_compare gives him a standart
winw and winh. Otherwise he checkes for valid numbers. If the number is not valid, he goes to exti and destroys the struct. 
Otherwise he puts this all in the struct. Back to fract_compare, back to entry. 

ft_win_mlx_img (heart.c):
here the pointers to the window images and addresse will be created. back to entry.

entry (heart.c );
Yes Loui has all the right tools to start his journey, first thing is to go to the fract_base!

fft_fract_base: (heart.c)
here there is only looked at his number (which road to travel), and he will be send to the sepcific road to fill up his struct
with some base values. 

ft_julia/mandel/unkknown _base (name of road):
putts some struct values from 0 to a specific value for this travel. Sends Loui to a different function to get his colors. 

ft_get_color(colors. c)
looks at his colors and decide what his base color will be(the color that is inbetween stable and not stable) sends him back to 
base function.

ft_julia/mandel/unkknown _base (name of road):
He is all filled up and sends him to fract_set.

ft_fract_set (heart):
looks at his name and sends him to the big calculating function. If he comes back from this well, fract set will put all the stuff 
that has been put in memory to the window on the screen, and als add maybe some text. 

julia/mandelbrot (name of road):
Here we will go to every pixel of the screen, so iterate with fract->x and fract->y, for each pixel loui goes to the 
calc_name function.

ft_calc(julia/mandelbrot) (name of road):
For every positon of the pixel on the screen is calcualited with a specific functions of the point is stable or unstable. 
Goes to infinity, blows up. It will test the for a X amount of times. If it reaches the X, lets say 50, it will be considerd
stable and be colored BLACK. If it reaches a unstable state before it will stop doing this function and get a color, this 
is the base color times the times it has been tested. When a numbers blows up is decides by the infi number. 
infi: the higher this number, the more it's it can get so more color. the lower the less color.the lower more point will be black. 
in here He gets sent to magnitude and square, the put_pixel_to_image put it into memory. the location and the color. If all 
the pixels are set it goes back to fract_set

ft_fract_Set(heart)
all the pixel have a color in memory. it will now put this to the window and the text. 
Here it stays in the loop and is the END unless, something happens! because in entry arae to loops, for mouse en key events, 
and the loop itself.
